### Ideas centrales
- This article aimsto provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning based recommender systems. More concretely,we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning based recommendation models, along with providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art.
- Recently, deep learning hasbeen revolutionizing the recommendation architectures dramatically and brings more opportunities to improvethe performance of recommender.

### *Challenges*:
- these three works are inuential in this research area, this survey lost sight ofother emerging high quality works
- in today’s research climate (and even industrial), there is completely no reason to not used deep learning based tools for developmentof any recommender system
- A common argument against deep neuralnetworks is that the hidden weights and activations are generally non-interpretable, limiting explainability.

### Aspecto interesantes
- One of the most aractive properties of neuralarchitectures is that they are (1) end-to-end differentiable and (2) provide suitableinductive biasescatered to theinput data type
-  It replaces the wide componentwith a neural interpretation of factorization machine. Compared to wide & deep model, DeepFM does not requiretedious feature engineering
-  By extending this model, Chen et al. [13] devised a locally-connected wide & deep learning model for largescale industrial-level recommendation task. It employs the ecient locally-connected network to replace thedeep learning component, which decreases the running time by one order of magnitud
- Directly applying CNNs to vanilla collaborative ltering is also viable.
